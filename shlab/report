first implement signal handlers for sigtstp, sigint
to exit out of shell

The pdf said that it is required to check the return value of every single system call,
so I used a wrapper function

Now implement the eval function. I referred to the code in the textbook.
Then implement builtin_cmd - quit, jobs, bg, fg

Then it would be natural to implement do_bgfg
implement it.

Then I figured that I need the waitfg function...

while implementing the eval function, I found out that I should check the return values of
sigprocmask functions so implement wrappers for those mask functions
